# Intro
GTEx provides gene/transcript level expression datasets across dozens of people over dozens of human tissues. However, the eye was not used. Over a dozen disparate studies have looked at the transcriptome in different portions of the human eye, more commonly in the RPE, retina, and cornea. Here we collate and re-process all of the available human eye-tissue RNA-seq data. We also process GTEx and ENCODE tissue and cell line data, respectively, in an identical manner. This allows for a comparison of gene expression signatures of eye tissues relative to GTEx and ENCODE data sets.
